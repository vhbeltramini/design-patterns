## Design patters implemented using Go

- Builder

The builder pattern is used in go when a construction of an entity get more complicated. When we have a factory method with more than 10 arguments it's not much productive so a good solution is to use the builder pattern instead.
He allows us to build an object with several different builders so when an object is very complicated with serveral atributes we can divide it into different builders.
